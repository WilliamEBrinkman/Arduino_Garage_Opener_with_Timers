# Arduino_Garage_Opener_with_Timers
Arduino Garage Door Opener with 2nd Relay and Browser Adjustable timers

Follow on to the earlier project with a few modifications.
1.  2nd browser page that will allow adjustments to the timer/alarms
2.  Timer/alarm time now stored in the EEPROM so a power off cycle will not reset them
3.  2nd relay added for a ON/OFF control at certain times.  Checkbox on the browser will
       also activate the relay.
